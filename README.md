# Systems Approach BAS-META â€“ Bridge
*The analysis and manipulation of complex systems from a top-down modular approach. Students learn how to divide a complex system into smaller modules and mapping them down to their single components, identifying sources of power, control signals, and conversions of energy along the way.*

```
1. Troubleshoot malfunctions through localizing, identifying and where possible
correcting root causes.
2. Document malfunctions to be passed on to the appropriate experts for resolution,
and when appropriate exchange or replace defective component.
3. Recognize potential or impending malfunctions and contact expert assistance in
order to keep the production line functioning and to prevent production loss.
4. Perform routine, preventive maintenance.
5. Explain the principal operations of the mechatronic subsystems in a complex
system.
6. Explain how mechatronic subsystems work together.
7. Interpret the technical documents, reports, and outlines specific to the system, and
be able to consult with experts.
8. Apply teamwork skills when coordinating activities with upstream and
downstream operations.
9. Implement safety regulations required for operation of the system.
```
*LEARNING OUTCOMES, PROGRAM OUTCOMES AND CORE ABILITIES*
1. Manipulate system characteristics of
mechanical and fluid power systems.
2. Manipulate system characteristics of both
AC and DC circuits.
3. Construct basic control systems for
industrial applications.
4. Apply knowledge of schematics and
technical drawings to the construction of
mechatronic systems.
5. Integrate mechanical, fluid power, AC/DC
circuits, into a mechatronics system under
computerized control.

## Final: SMSCP Exam

-- A focus on system understanding, troubleshooting, and problem-solving skills results in individuals who can adapt to new work situations quickly and appropriately.
